# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

What I did (in addition to the existing codes of writing password to password input )

1. Define and create variables 
    1.1 array of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters)
    1.2 prompt length with condition of 8-128 characters
    1.3 selected Characters to be picked by user

2. Create function definition
    2.1 getUseroptions with different character types that users need to choose at least one type
    2.2 Create "if" conditions so we prompt and alert users to meet the criteria 
    2.3 Then we execute/call the function to write the password

3. Generate password
    3.1 Run the loop with selection of character types picked by users
    3.2 Use "push" and Math.Random to add string of characters randomly 
    3.3 Then execute it with return and display it.
